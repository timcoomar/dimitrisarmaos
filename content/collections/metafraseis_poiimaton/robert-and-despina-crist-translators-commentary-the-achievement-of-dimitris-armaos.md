            Among the broad range of today’s accomplished Greek poets, Dimitris Armaos holds a unique position in his repeated austere opposition to forms of poetry that fail to depart sufficiently from the idiom and style of the past. Whether he works in traditional forms like the ballad or the pantun, cited below, or in free verse forms. More, perhaps, than most of his Greek contemporaries, Armaos is acutely aware of Harold Bloom’s thesis of “The Anxiety of Influence”: namely, that any poetry that is not for the most part innovative is dead from its inception.
            Accordingly, Armaos’s own poetry is totally sui generous, and he continually rails against fellow poets who fail to any degree in the  quest for dynamic freshness.  With sardonic humor, he observes that the practitioner of deadening repetition is an “abuser” of the “virginal” spirit of creativity.  “How can you not be abashed,” he challenges in “squandering decades like trimesters” (Free Notations).
In contrast, Armaos styles himself, not a skylark of poetic beauty, but “many a year a blackbird” (In the Heart’s Serene Frenzy).
            Armaos is as powerful in his social observation as in his unique poetic voice.  He is able in a single stoke, for example, to castigate the phony “accessories” of today’s feminine marketplace. The grim, hollow city of his verse recalls the world of Eliot’s Waste Land. It is a city “where the cold repeatedly  caged me in solitude” (In the Heart’s Serene Frenzy).  Likewise, it is a place of petty violated souls, as he poignantly  observes in Pestilence at Dawn.
             Armaos probes and articulates the rare moment of feeling and insight. He is a poet who has a knack for  magically capturing the quality of a sensibility that is engaged in a true odyssey of arcane experience, for instance that of Melville whom Armaos pictures in an amazingly evocative poem,  mesmerized by wondrous tales narrated by strange old sailors in obscure taverns and bars (Homage to Herman Melville).  Armaos surprises us here with the intimacy of his feeling for this strange genius, as  he does in his treatment of an Eliot, a Pound, an Emily Dickinson.
            Reading this verse, one is continually swept back and forth between the delight of the poet’s acute intellect and sharp inventiveness, and the anguish of his wounded soul (expressed without self-pity).  In turn, we are impressed by his reworking of verse forms, frequently recalling, with delightful freshness, for example, the ballad of European and Anglo-American tradition.  We  found to be of particular interest Manslaughter in which Armaos works with creative force in the pantum form, resembling the powerful repetitions of the villanelle, as masterfully employed by Dylan Thomas and Theodore Roethke.
            Manslaughter is a poignant portrait of the spiritual emptiness that plagues modern society in general.  I know of few poets who have so bitterly portrayed the complacent viciousness of the contemporary power elite of the “double city” that “makes and unmakes” mankind, as he puts it in Res Extensa.  Armaos does not hesitate to suggest that spiritual vacuity in society is a state advantageous to the powers that be.  As he maintains, they wield the “dark pen” that severs us from the “ancient seeds” of wisdom, yet there is a “dove of green” (art, poetry, and spiritual beauty) that flashes in rare moments within our heart.
            The challenge and delight of the translators is to attempt to discover an analogous magic in the other tongue that reflects Armaos’s special idiom of thought, sensibility, and language.  The acute perceptiveness, stubborn newness and  stylistic resourcefulness of his voice hopefully find, if not identical twins, fraternal ones, in the English versions we offer with joy and gratitude.
